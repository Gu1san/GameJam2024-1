### DISCLAIMER:

This game is a prototype, developed in 48 hours during a game jam. We believe in the potential of the idea, and our intention is to take the project forward until it is completed



### LORE:

In 'The Healing', follow the main character after waking up in an unknown place, sick, and with no memories. Amidst the darkness, you must proceed with only a flashlight, solving puzzles to unlock rooms and progress, all while the character's mind plays tricks on the perception of reality.

But beware, you are not alone; creatures roam the rooms, drawn to the light, and they will try to pursue you to make you one of them. A game where you can't trust what's in front of you, where light becomes both your friend and exposes you to danger, leading to a shocking ending!



### CONTROLS:

Use the Q key to release a light fragment that distracts enemies, press  E  to emit a beam of light that gives you time to escape from them, press SPACEBAR to increase your field of vision (be cautious, as it attracts the attention of enemies), and move boxes around the environment pressing SHIFT
